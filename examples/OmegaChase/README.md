# Omega Chase
Omega Chase is an Arduboy port of the classic arcade style shooter game Omega Race.
In this game, you control a spaceship and must navigate through an arena, shooting 
down enemy ships and avoiding obstacles. The player must destroy and avoid drone ships, 
command ships, death ships and space mines. The death ships fire back and are very accurate.
The ship bounces off an invisible barrier on the edges of the screen that briefly appears when hit.
Wall bouncing can be used to your advantage when hunting enemies. Extra lives are awarded at 500 and 1000 points.
The objective of the game is to survive as long as possible while racking up as high a score as possible. 
The levels increase in difficulty as the game proceeds.
