# Description

This is a game that has many implementations. For the Arduboy, there is, for example [03_tiny_2048](https://github.com/akkera102/03_tiny_2048).

My objective with this game is to learn 

* Arduboy programming
* Some C++
* The Model-View-Controller framework.
* Creating a parallel desktop version that replicates the Arduboy screen for
  easier debugging. Inspired from [Arduboy3D](https://github.com/jhhoward/Arduboy3D).

# Installation

1. In a terminal, navigate to the Sketchbook folder. This is usually in `$HOME/Arduino` or `$HOME/Documents/Arduino`. The exact location can be found in the Arduino IDE: Menu File
&#x2192;Preferences... .
2. Execute `git clone git@github.com:awisse/2048-Arduboy.git`.
