# ArduBoy Jet Pac 

So after about 30 hours hard work I've finally finished my clone of the classic ZX Spectrum game 'Jet Pac'. I've tried to recreate the look and feel of the original game as best as I could. The game will get progressively faster with more objects to avoid as the game goes on.

I've tested the game as much as I could but there is no doubt a bug or two left to iron out so please let me know if you find any.

##GAME INSTRUCTIONS:

You are an astronaut on an alien planet with a Jet Pac. When the game first starts you have to assemble your rocket by picking up the middle and top sections and dropping them onto the bottom section on the ground. Once the rocket is assembled you need to fuel your rocket. Fuel cells (Marked 'F') will drop down and you need to pick them up and drop them onto the rocket. A line along the top of the screen will show you how much fuel your rocket has. Once the line reaches 100% at the top right it will start to flash to indicate your rocket is now ready to board. Jump inside the rocket and take off. The level is now complete.

After a while, your rocket will land again to refuel. Again, pick up the fuel cells and drop them on the rocket as before.

You get 25 points for shooting each of the baddies trying to kill you and 100 points for picking up a rocket section or fuel cell. There are an additional 500 points each time you board a completed and fully fueled rocket.

All the while you are doing this, obstacles will be trying to kill you. You need to avoid the obstacles to stay alive. If you get hit you will die. You have 5 lives when the game starts.

Every 5 levels you will have a new rocket to build.  
Every 8 levels the monsters will cycle and you will have 1 more added to their numbers (up to a maximum of 10). They will also get progressively faster as the game progresses.

Bonus items will drop from time to time and these items will flash. Pick them up for an extra 250 points.

##KEYS:

Left Button= LEFT  
Right Button= RIGHT  
UP or A Button = Fire JetPac Thrusters  
Down or B Button = Fire Lasers  

Good luck and let me know what your high scores are.

Have fun.
