Background
-----
This explanation references the "background display logic" PNG seen in our "mockups" folder.

- The reference PNG is 3 Arduboy screens wide and 1 Arduboy screen tall - each grey square is a 16x16 pixel grid section.
- As you can see in the reference PNG, our background fixtures (seen in the area indicated in RED) are spaced apart evenly from each other by 80 pixels.
- These fixtures will either be a torch or a window. There's a 2/3 chance for a torch to appear and a 1/3 chance for a window to appear.
- Each torch has a 1/3 chance of carrying a Bad Flame. Each Bad Flame has a 50% chance to jump towards the player or stay on the wall.
- Our background features are surrouned by brick tiles (indicated in the dark blue and light blue areas) and these appear based on a set of possible options.
- Here is the key we are using for the brick tile placement: 0 indicates no bricks, 1 indicates the first image in our brick spritesheet (dungeonBricks_16x16.png), 2 indicates the 2nd and 3 indicates the 3rd.
- Here are all 16 possible brick placement patterns:

30	20	02	03	20	01	00	20
21	13	33	30	01	32	12	31

00	02	00	20	01	03	02	20
32	21	13	12	20	12	31	03

- Each pattern has an equal (1/16) chance of appearing.


Chain Graphics
-----
This explanation references the "chains display logic" PNG seen in our "mockups" folder.

- The reference PNG is 1 Arduboy screen wide and 1 Arduboy screen tall - each grey square is a 16x16 pixel grid section.
- The light blue, medium blue and dark blue grid sections represent the 3 sections of each possible chain set.
- Any chains appearing in the blue area are always drawn 100% of the time.
- Chains appearing in the bright red area have a 50% chance of being drawn. They are drawn 1/2 the time.
- Chains appearing in the dark red area have only a 25% chance of being drawn. They are only drawn 1/4 of the time.
- Here is the key we are using for the chain graphic placement: 0 indicates no chain links, 2 indicates a chain 2 links long, 3 indicates a chain 3 links long and 4 indicates a chain 4 links long.
- Here are all 8 possible chain graphic combinations:

024	420	402	224

034	324	230	340

- Each pattern has an equal (1/8) chance of appearing.
