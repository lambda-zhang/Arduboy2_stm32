# RUND.INO
Take Chrome's premier offline-first mascot✱ with you for a coin-cell-powered, 100% disconnected adventure in your pockets with [Arduboy](https://www.arduboy.com/)!

## How to use?
Use a tool like [`avrgirl`](https://github.com/noopkat/avrgirl-arduino) to flash `rund.ino.leonardo.hex` on an Arduboy ([or a devkit](https://www.tindie.com/products/bateske/arduboy/)) — or use the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to hack on/compile/flash the `rund.ino` sketch.

✱ *no cretaceous reptiles — or IP-rights, for that matter — were (meant to be) harmed during the creation of this game.*
